# Purpose of a Linker Script

## Memory Layout Control

The primary purpose of a linker script is to control how the sections of your program are laid out in memory. This is essential in environments where you don't have an operating system to manage memory for you, such as in a kernel or hypervisor.

## Defining Symbols

It allows you to define symbols that can be used in your code to refer to specific memory locations.

## Key Components of a Linker Script

### Memory Sections

The script defines various memory sections like .text (code), .data (initialized data), .bss (uninitialized data), and .rodata (read-only data).

### Memory Addresses

You can specify the starting addresses for these sections. This is particularly important in embedded systems or kernels where certain memory regions are dedicated to specific purposes.

### Section Ordering

The script can control the order in which sections are placed in memory.

### Symbol Definitions

Define symbols to mark addresses or sizes of sections, which can be referenced in your program.

## Basic Concepts

### Sections vs. Segments

In a linker script, you deal with sections (parts of your code and data). When the program is loaded, these sections are combined into segments (such as text or data segments), which the loader manages.

### Entry Point

You can specify the entry point of your program, which is the location where the execution starts.

### Alignment

You can also control alignment to ensure sections align on certain memory boundaries, which is important for performance and correctness on many architectures.

### Example Explained

In the simple example provided earlier:

```ld
ld
Copy code
SECTIONS
{
  . = 1M;

  .text : {
    *(.text)
  }

  .rodata : {
    *(.rodata*)
  }

  .data : {
    *(.data)
  }

  .bss : {
    *(.bss)
  }
}
```

#### `. = 1M;`

This sets the location counter (.) to 1MB. It means the first section will start at the 1MB mark in memory.

#### .text : { *(.text) }

This places the .text section (which contains your executable code) at the current location counter. The `*(.text)` means it includes all .text sections from your input files.

The same principle applies to .rodata (read-only data like constants), .data (initialized data), and .bss (uninitialized data, which is zeroed at startup).

## Customizing the Linker Script

Your specific hypervisor project might have unique requirements regarding memory layout, especially if you're dealing with special hardware or need to place code and data in specific memory regions. In such cases, you'll tailor your linker script to meet these requirements.

Understanding and correctly utilizing a linker script is key to successful systems programming in environments where you have complete control over how your program is laid out and executed in memory.
