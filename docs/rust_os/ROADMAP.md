# Roadmap

## Establishing Foundations

### Research and Conceptual Understanding

Study the basics of Type 1 hypervisors.
Understand their role in directly controlling hardware and managing guest operating systems.
Read about existing Type 1 hypervisors like Xen, VMware ESXi, and others for inspiration and understanding.

### Set Up Your Rust Development Environment

Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed. You can use rustup to manage Rust versions.
Set up your preferred IDE with Rust support (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, or CLion with Rust plugins).

### Create a Basic Rust Project

Use cargo new hypervisor_project to create a new Rust project.
Familiarize yourself with the project structure and Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager.
Task 2: Designing the Hypervisor

### Architecture Planning

Decide on the key features and capabilities of your hypervisor (e.g., supported guest OSes, hardware virtualization extensions like Intel VT-x or AMD-V).
Outline the components you'll need (e.g., CPU scheduler, memory manager, I/O manager).

### Document Your Design

Create a high-level design document outlining your architecture. This will guide your development and can be refined over time.

## Deep Dive into Rust for System Programming

### Study Rust for Low-Level Operations

Focus on Rust features relevant to system programming (e.g., unsafe code, FFI).
Experiment with small Rust programs to manipulate low-level resources (like memory allocation, hardware interfacing).

## Initial Code Development

### Set Up Basic Hypervisor Structure

Start coding the basic structure of your hypervisor based on your design document.
Implement a simple module, like a basic memory manager or a CPU state handler.

### Testing and Debugging

Write tests for your initial modules. Testing is crucial in hypervisor development due to the complexity and potential security implications.
Set up a debugging environment that allows you to inspect the state of your hypervisor, potentially using QEMU for emulation.
Task 5: Iterative Development and Testing

### Develop Core Components

Iteratively develop each core component of your hypervisor, starting with the most critical ones (like the VM control structure, memory virtualization).
Regularly test and document each component.

### Hardware Interactions

Implement mechanisms to interact with hardware virtualization features (e.g., using VT-x/AMD-V for CPU virtualization).

## Advanced Features and Optimization

### Implement Advanced Features

Once the basics are stable, work on advanced features (like live migration, advanced networking).

### Performance Tuning

Profile and optimize your hypervisor. Focus on key areas like memory usage, CPU scheduling efficiency, and I/O throughput.

## Finalizing and Documentation

## Final Testing and Bug Fixes

Conduct extensive testing, including stress tests and security audits.
Fix any bugs or issues that arise.

## Complete Documentation

Ensure your code is well-documented.
Create user guides or additional documentation as needed.
