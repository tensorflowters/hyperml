# Requirements

This post replaces the (now deprecated) Unit Testing and Integration Tests posts.

It assumes that you have followed the A Minimal Rust Kernel post after 2019-04-27.

Mainly, it requires that you have a .cargo/config.toml file that sets a default target and defines a runner executable.
