# Basics

## Kernel Bootstrapping

Start by writing the code needed to bootstrap your kernel. This involves setting up a minimal runtime environment where you can run Rust code. It includes initializing the CPU, memory, and other hardware resources.

## Minimal Rust Kernel

Develop a minimal Rust kernel that can run on your target hardware. This kernel should be able to initialize itself and provide basic output (like printing to the console), which is crucial for debugging.

## Memory Management

Implement basic memory management capabilities. This includes setting up page tables and handling memory allocation and deallocation. Memory management is a core aspect of any hypervisor, as it needs to manage and isolate memory for different virtual machines.

## CPU Virtualization

Start coding the CPU virtualization components. This includes handling CPU instructions that need to be virtualized and managing the CPU state for each virtual machine.

## I/O Virtualization

Implement basic input/output virtualization. This might be as simple as virtualizing console I/O to begin with.

## Basic VM Creation

Create the ability to initialize and run a very basic virtual machine. This might be a simple 'hello world' VM or a similar lightweight example.

## Testing and Debugging Infrastructure

Establish a robust testing and debugging setup. Given the complexity and low-level nature of hypervisor development, having a good testing and debugging process is essential.

## Integration with Mojo AI Accelerators

If your project involves using Mojo AI accelerators, you'll need to integrate and manage these within your hypervisor. This includes allocating resources to the accelerators and managing their operation.
